## SMTP/POP Mail 1\.2 \*UPDATED\*


</div>

### Description

This is a class module that contains all (or at least..most) routines that needed to send emails using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Also has the support to add/encode/decode multiple attachments using either UUencode, or Base64. Base64 implementations conform to MIME standard, and MIME header is generated along with the file.

For now, the class doesn't has any POP capability as yet, but it will be added soon.. And also adding support for pipelining, binary transfer through chunking, proxy support, etc (Which all are needed in my current project ).

(*UPDATED* Now attachments can be send using a very easy to implement file queue system. As well as fixed the wrong path extractor routine.)

I am trying to make the class so that the code required in the main project is minimal. Please give me your comments, and enjoy!
 
### More Info
 
It was made in 2 days, with not much errors able to be recreated to test the code, so if you found any, please let me know. It has the functions for SMTP error codes, but hasn't been fully finished yet.
